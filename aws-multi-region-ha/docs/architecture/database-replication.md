# Database Replication Architecture

## Overview
This document details the Aurora Global Database implementation spanning Sydney (Primary) and Oregon (Secondary) regions, focusing on replication configuration and failover mechanisms.

## Aurora Global Database Setup
### Primary Region (Sydney)
- Cluster: primary-cluster-demo
- Instance Class: db.r5.large
- Engine: Aurora MySQL 8.0
- Write Operations: All write operations
- Endpoint: primary-cluster-demo.cluster-cn0gigquicc1...

### Secondary Region (Oregon)
- Cluster: secondary-cluster-demo
- Instance Class: db.r5.large
- Engine: Aurora MySQL 8.0
- Read Operations: Local reads for API service
- Endpoint: secondary-cluster-demo.cluster-cvmmme46qtv1...

## Replication Configuration
### Data Synchronization
- Near real-time replication
- Typical latency: < 1 second
- Automatic conflict resolution
- Transaction ordering preserved

### Network Configuration
- Cross-region data transfer
- Dedicated replication channel
- Encrypted data transfer
- Automatic bandwidth management

## Failover Mechanism
### Automatic Failover
- Monitors primary region health
- Detects regional failures
- Promotes secondary to primary
- Updates endpoint routing

### Manual Failover
- Planned maintenance support
- Controlled promotion process
- Minimal data loss guarantee
- Rolling back capability

## Monitoring and Metrics
### CloudWatch Metrics
- ReplicationLag
- FreeableMemory
- DatabaseConnections
- ReadIOPS/WriteIOPS

### Performance Insights
- Query performance tracking
- Resource utilization
- Wait event analysis
- Load pattern monitoring

## Backup Strategy
### Automated Backups
- Daily snapshots
- Transaction logs
- Cross-region backup copies
- Point-in-time recovery

### Retention Policy
- Automated backups: 7 days
- Manual snapshots: 30 days
- Transaction logs: 7 days

## Operational Considerations
### Maintenance Windows
- Primary: Sunday 12:00 AM AEST
- Secondary: Sunday 12:00 PM PDT
- Coordinated updates

### Cost Optimization
- Storage optimization
- Instance right-sizing
- Read replica management
- Backup storage lifecycle
